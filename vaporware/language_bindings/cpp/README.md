#Overview
This Reposetory provides a C++-Library that enables easy usage of the 
Vaporlight and a simple cli-tool to controll the LEDs directly.

## The library
The library provides an interface that is very easy to use and completly hides every networking or lowlevel-stuff from
it's users. It is implemented in a way that makes the usage of the header very cheap in compiletime though.

## The shell
The shell is a primitive userinterface for the vaporlight. Nevertheless it should be enough to do basic testing of the
vaporlight or figuring out, how the library can be used.
